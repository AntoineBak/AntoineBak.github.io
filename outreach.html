		<h2>RJMI - Rendez-vous des Jeunes Math√©maticiennes et informaticiennes</h2>

		<p>
		I took part in the <a href="https://filles-et-maths.fr/rjmi/">RJMI</a> of INRIA Paris that took place in October 2024 by 
		animating two 2-hours workshops with a group of 6 high school students. This workshop gives a high school-level introduction to a research area in mathematics 
		through problem solving. <br>
			<br>
		This event is aimed at high school girls who are interested in mathematics and computer science. Through workshops and 
		informal discussions with mathematicians and computer scientists, we encourage them to pursue a scientific career and give 
		them a better knowledge of the possible path in these fields. <br>
